Test 1:
- Dark area (maybe just cooldown)
- Often found wrong switch 'location' (e.g. wall), wrong IR readings

Test 2 (after addition of sonar outside area detecton):
- Always on dark area (??)

Test 3 (same as above):
- Now it worked normally.
- Sonar distance does help it stay within box, however if objects like e.g. a chair are nearby then the robot can be confused.
- The robot still gets stuck on the side (like observed last time).
- Often found wrong switch 'location' (e.g. wall), wrong IR readings - it does eventually find the switch through trial and error

Test 4 (same but changed closed range and long range sonar thresholds):
- front bumper fell off

Test 5
- Robot not moving straight when in dark area
- IR fixed, sonar fixed
- Maximum sonar distance allows for robot to stay within, need to use that to make it more explorative
