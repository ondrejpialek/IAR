Code:
---------

Previously:
Fully OOP code.

Then:
Trigonometry (angles) algorithm.
Find dark spots using two light sensors at the bottom.
2 thresholds (grey area, black area, super-black strips).

Results:
Dark areas very well recognized, with different lighting conditions and all the different mining sites.

Trigonometry sometimes worked, but very very unreliable.

Changing design:
---------

Added lightbulb and two light sensors at the bottom.

First:

Added higher floors on the hood including a 3rd light sensors (same level as light from switch), and then sonar on-top.
Also added FACE :D.
Experimentation with sonar revealed how it works in a cone etc.

Then:

Remove hood.
Put whiskers on the side bent, over the wheels (removed from front and back).
Add bumpers to the front.
Two Light sensors still at the back.
Reinforced wheels with additional security by locking them on the outside too.
